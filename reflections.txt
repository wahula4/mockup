You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

The new skills I have learned are html tags that I was unfamiliar with.
The assignment was easy because it did not require any CSS.
The only difficult part is remembering what CSS tags achieve the desired effect.
The problem solving skills I used were using a resource such as W3Schools to search html tags.
